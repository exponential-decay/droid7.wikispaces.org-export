# droid7.wikispaces.org-export
An export of the DROID7 Wikispaces Account

The original site was an exercise in requirements gathering for a future, never released DROID, format identification project. The requirements remain unsorted and unprioritized, some may already have been implemented! 

This author has no direct influence on the DROID tool, this remains in the custody of The National Archives UK: http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/manage-information/policy-process/digital-continuity/file-profiling-tool-droid/

At time of writing Wikispaces restrictions in ROBOTS.txt made web-scraping difficult so this has driven the choice of export to three different formats. 

- HTML
- PDF
- WikiText

Thank you for visiting this reposotory.
